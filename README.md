# Mo'orea Storyline

I am currently part of an OSU NRT project centered on investigating the impact of terrestrial or anthropogenic nutrient concentrations on coral reef health in Mo'orea.

The specific problem focused on in this storymap is a tour of the siting of the island, common onshore sources of nutrients and sediments that may impact the coral reef surrounding the island, introduces the presence of channels within the reef that may impact water circulation, and hints at future research to resolve the impact of terrestrial nutrient and sediment sources on the reef.
